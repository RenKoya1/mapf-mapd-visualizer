This repository hosts the web-based version of the MAPF (Multi-Agent Pathfinding) and MAPD (Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery) Visualizer, adapted from the original [Kei18/mapf-visualizer](https://github.com/Kei18/mapf-visualizer). The app provides an interactive and intuitive way to visualize MAPF and MAPD solutions directly in your browser.

> üõ†Ô∏è This project extends the functionality of [JustinShetty/mapf-visualizer](https://github.com/JustinShetty/mapf-visualizer) by adding full support for MAPD (Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery) scenarios, including agent states such as `PICKING`, `CARRYING`, `DELIVERED`, and `IDLE`.

This project runs entirely client-side and is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

## Features

- **Browser-Based Interface**: No installation required, simply access the app through the GitHub Pages site.
- **Customizable Input**: Upload your own MAPF and MAPD maps and solutions.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe agent movements step-by-step.

## Demo

## Usage

1. **Upload a Map File**: Load your map file (.txt format).
2. **Upload a Solution File**: Load the corresponding solution file (.txt format).
3. **Visualize**: The solution will automatically play
4. **Controls**:
   - **Play/Pause**: Start or pause the visualization.
   - **Step Forward/Backward**: Navigate the simulation frame-by-frame.
   - **Step Size Adjustment**: Change the playback speed.
   - **Restart Animation**: Restart the visualization from the beginning.
   - **Toggle Animation**: Enable or disable the animation.
   - **Reset View**: Reset the visualization to the initial view.
   - **Take a Screenshot**: Capture the current state of the visualization as an image.
   - **Toggle Agent IDs**: Show or hide the IDs of the agents.
   - **Toggle Cell IDs**: Show or hide the IDs of the cells.
   - **Toggle Traveled Paths**: Show or hide the paths that agents have traveled.
   - **Toggle Goal Markers**: Show or hide the goal markers for the agents.
   - **Toggle Goal Vectors**: Show or hide the vectors pointing to the agents' goals.

## File Format

### Map File

The map file defines the grid layout with open locations and obstacles. Format example:

```
type octile
height 4
width 8
map
.@@@@@@.
..@...@.
@...@...
@@@@@@@.
```

- **type**: Always `octile` for visualizations.
- **height**: Number of rows in the grid.
- **width**: Number of columns in the grid.
- **map**: Grid definition using characters:
  - `.`: Open location.
  - `@`: Obstacle.

### Solution File

Each line represents a **single timestep**:

```
<time_step>: (<x>,<y>[,<orientation>][,<state>]),(<x>,<y>[,<orientation>][,<state>]),...
```

- `time_step`: An integer timestamp.
- `x`, `y`: Grid coordinates.
- `orientation` (optional): Direction the agent is facing (e.g. `X_PLUS`, `Y_MINUS`).
- `state` (optional, MAPD only): The agent‚Äôs current state (see below).

- Each line defines the agents' states at a particular timestep:
  - **Timestep**: Integer identifier before the colon.
  - **Pose**: Each `(...),` represents an agent's pose. The first two elements are the x and y coordinates respectively. The third element (e.g. `X_PLUS`) is optional if your solver considers orientation.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that either **all** or **none** of the poses must contain orientation. A mix of orientation and orientation-less poses is not supported.

#### üì¶ MAPF Example (Path Finding Only)

```
0:(0,0,Y_MINUS),
1:(0,0,X_PLUS),
2:(1,0,X_PLUS),
3:(1,0,Y_PLUS),
4:(1,1,Y_PLUS),
5:(1,1,X_PLUS),
```

#### üì¶ MAPD Example (Pickup and Delivery)

```
0:(18,26,PICKING),(29,21,PICKING),
1:(17,26,PICKING),(29,22,PICKING),
2:(16,26,CARRYING),(28,22,CARRYING),
3:(15,26,CARRYING),(27,22,DELIVERED),
4:(15,25,CARRYING),(26,22,IDLE),

```

#### üéØ Acceptable state is

```
export enum AgentState {
  PICKING,
  CARRYING,
  DELIVERED,
  IDLE,
  NONE,
}
```
